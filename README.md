## xmpp adapter for ioBroker

A XMPP Client that interconnects iobroker with your XMPP server. Send messages to your account or trigger actions by messages to this bot.

### How to use

This adapter can be used in different ways:

- Send messages to the jid you set up in adapter config to receive them in iobroker objects tree.
  This way you can use messages as trigger for events in script adapter.
- Send messages right to the adapter using sendTo commandd to receive them as xmpp messages.
  You can even select recipients.
  WIP: callbacks will be supported in the future â€“ hopefully. ;)

### sendTo Example code
```javascript
	// will send the message 'test' to all your configured users checked for *all messages*
	sendTo('xmpp.0', 'test');
	// will send the message 'This is a message to a specific jid' to *iob@your.xmpp*
	sendTo('xmpp.0', 'send', {message: 'This is a message to a specific jid', to: 'iob@your.xmpp'});
	// As above but send to more than one jid at the same time. Notice: This will not create a multi user chat.
	sendTo('xmpp.0', 'send', {message: 'This is a message to more than one jid', recipients: ['io-test@example.com', 'iob@your.xmpp']});
```
